# web-audio-app

In this individual project, we developed a web-based audio application that can process an audio input using various effects. We used the p5.js and p5.sound.js libraries to create the application. The effects that we added in were Low-pass Filter, High-pass Filter, Band-pass Filter, Waveshaper Distortion, Dynamic Compressor, Reverb, Delay, and the Master Volume. Different effects of varying levels can be used on the audio input.

Additionally, the audio controls include: Play, Pause, Stop, Skip-start, Skip-end, and Loop. There is also an option to record your own voice and use it in the application, as well as a dropdown menu to change the input audio from the pre-loaded audio to the microphone input.
